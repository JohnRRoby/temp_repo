testing a new setup
"A line I wrote on my computer" 
'A line I wrote on my local computer' 
'A line I wrote on my local computer and trying to escape quotes' 
"A line I wrote on my local computer and trying to escape quotes" 
""A line I wrote on my local computer and trying to escape quotes"" 
\"A line I wrote on my local computer and trying to escape quotes\" 
A line I wrote on my local computer and trying to escape quotes i am so basic 
And a final note to test the commit credentials
